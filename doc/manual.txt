NanoVM manual  (c) 2005 by Till Harbaum <till@harbaum.org>
----------------------------------------------------------

The NanoVM has been written under Linux. It shouldn't be a problem to compile
the code under Windows. However, things like the Makefiles etc may require
some tweaking.

1. Compile
----------

The NanoVM consists of two main parts: The VM itself and the helper
application. You need first to compile the NanoVMTool. To do this change into
the directory tool/src and type make. You'll need a java sdk with the
javax.comm installed. See the readme.txt in the tool directory for details.

Now you need to compile the NanoVM itself. Go to the appropriate build
directory (e.g. vm/build/asuro for the asuro) and type make. This will build
the NanoVM for that specifig plattform based on the configuration (Makefile
and config.h) in that directory. A "make uisp" will install the NanoVM on the
target plattform using the uisp program. 

See the config files to learn e.g. which baud rates are being used on
the different target plattforms.

2. Toolchain
------------

You'll need a avr cross compiler toolchain. Under Linux you might use the 
install_avr_gcc.sh script.

3. Uploading new files
----------------------

Once the NanoVM is installed and running you might use the Makefiles
to upload other software. Go to the build directory again and type "make
upload-classname" where classname may be the name of the class in the 
examples directory. E.g. typing "make upload-Fibonacci" to install the
Fibonacci test.
